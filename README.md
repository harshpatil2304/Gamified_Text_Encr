#  Web Based Gamified Text Encryptor
The solution is a Gamified Text Encryption application that is an advanced derivation of the traditional text encryption process by incorporating gamification elements and utilizing the AES Algorithm with SHA25.

In the proposed system, users are presented with interactive word games or challenges that they need to solve in order to encrypt their desired message. The encryption key is derived from the solution to the game, adding an extra layer of security to the encryption process. By integrating gamification elements, the system motivates users to actively participate in the encryption process and promotes a deeper understanding of encryption techniques. 

Furthermore, the application extends its functionality to file encryption and decryption. Users can leverage the generated encryption key to encrypt their files securely, ensuring their confidentiality and protection. Similarly, the application allows users to decrypt password-protected files using the corresponding encryption key, providing authorized access to the original file content. 

The integration of the AES algorithm guarantees strong encryption for both text messages and files, reinforcing the security of the entire system. By combining gamification, text encryption, and file encryption, the proposed system offers an exciting and simplistic solution to protect sensitive information and promote secure encryption practices.
